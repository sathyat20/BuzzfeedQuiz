# "Which Citrus Dessert are you?" BuzzFeed Quiz

*This BuzzFeed-Style Quiz tells you what kind of citrus dessert you are! I chose to focus on the style mostly though I did attempt to create a JSON file too but did not have enough time to complete the JavaScript portion.*

## What Worked Well
It was much easier to style the quiz once I had an idea of the theme/content as it made choosing colors/images much easier. I also had a much easier time with this lab with regards to arranging my images in div/flex boxes though did still face some challenges with regards to arranging items within the modal box. 

## What Didn't
Had a very hard time getting the modal to work and styling it. Especially hard was trying to get the different effects possible when the images were being hovered over, clicked on, etc. 

## Extra Credit
- Implemented the auto-scroll feature using JavaScript
- Fancy animation for modal box entry 
- Fancy button animation for start and submit buttons
